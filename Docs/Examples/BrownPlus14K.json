/*
    My personal preset for coding. Generates brown noise and
    combines with a bit of filtered white noise.
    
    My tinnitus is somewhere around 13.5 KHz and the highest
    frequency I can hear is around 14.5 KHz. Using a gaussian
    generator with a 14KHz -24dB/octave highpass filter works
    well to mask it.
