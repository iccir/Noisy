/*
    This is an exact port of Douglas McCausland's Brown Noise Max patch.
    It represents "true" brown noise generated from a random walk combined
    with a simple DC block node.
    
    Noisy's "Default Brown.json" uses a biquad highpass at 20Hz instead of
    the DC block. This produces better Auto Gain results compared to 
    Default Pink and Default White.
